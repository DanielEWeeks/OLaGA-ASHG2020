	Abstract = {Large-scale whole-genome sequencing studies have enabled the analysis of rare variants (RVs) associated with complex phenotypes. Commonly used RV association tests have limited scope to leverage variant functions. We propose STAAR (variant-set test for association using annotation information), a scalable and powerful RV association test method that effectively incorporates both variant categories and multiple complementary annotations using a dynamic weighting scheme. For the latter, we introduce 'annotation principal components', multidimensional summaries of in silico variant annotations. STAAR accounts for population structure and relatedness and is scalable for analyzing very large cohort and biobank whole-genome sequencing studies of continuous and dichotomous traits. We applied STAAR to identify RVs associated with four lipid traits in 12,316 discovery and 17,822 replication samples from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine Program. We discovered and replicated new RV associations, including disruptive missense RVs of NPC1L1 and an intergenic region near APOC1P1 associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.},

@article{Carlson:2020aa,
	Abstract = {The current understanding of the genetic architecture of lipids has largely come from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To date, few GWAS have examined the genetic architecture of lipids in Polynesians, and none have in Samoans, whose unique population history, including many population bottlenecks, may provide insight into the biological foundations of variation in lipid levels. Here we performed a GWAS of four fasting serum lipid levels: total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides (TG) in a sample of 2849 Samoans, with validation genotyping for associations in a replication cohort comprising 1798 Samoans and American Samoans. We identified multiple genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 × 10-8) previously seen in other populations-APOA1 with TG, CETP with HDL, and APOE with TC and LDL-and several suggestive associations (P < 1 × 10-5), including an association of variants downstream of MGAT1 and RAB21 with HDL. However, we observed different association signals for variants near APOE than what has been previously reported in non-Polynesian populations. The association with several known lipid loci combined with the newly identified associations with variants near MGAT1 and RAB21 suggest that while some of the genetic architecture of lipids is shared between Samoans and other populations, part of the genetic architecture may be Polynesian-specific.},

@article{Arslanian:2020aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: In Samoa, where 80% of the adult population is living with obesity, understanding the determinants of adiposity and growth during infancy may inform prevention efforts. We examined the association of a missense variant, rs373863828, in the CREBRF gene with body composition in Samoan infants. Adults with one or more copies of the rs373863828 minor allele (A) have higher odds of obesity, based on body-mass index (BMI), but paradoxically decreased odds of diabetes compared to those without the allele. Our study may offer novel insight into the natural history and pathogenesis of this unexpected relationship.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: In a prospective study, we measured body composition in early infancy, and at 2- and 4-months of age using anthropometry and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We genotyped subjects at the CREBRF rs373863828 locus and compared infants with (AA/AG) and without (GG) the variant. In longitudinal analyses, we calculated the absolute change in each outcome from the early infant to the 4-month assessment, adjusting for baseline and other covariates.
RESULTS: In cross-sectional analyses, there was no significant difference in infant BMI or fat mass by genotype. After adjusting for covariates, infants with the variant had 4.0 $\pm$ 1.8 g more bone mass (p = 0.026) and 210.9 $\pm$ 79.6 g more lean mass (p = 0.009) at 4-months and accumulated 176.9 $\pm$ 73.0 g more lean mass between the early infant and 4-month assessment (p = 0.017).
CONCLUSIONS: The CREBRF rs373863828 minor allele (A) was not associated with increased BMI or adiposity in Samoan infants, but instead with increased lean and bone mass. Our findings suggest that lean (i.e., muscle) and bone mass accretion should be explored as pathways to explain the "protective" effect of the CREBRF variant against diabetes.},
