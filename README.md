The publication list is maintained in a BibDesk 'bib' file.  It is exported from BibDesk using templates from https://github.com/alejandroerickson/bibdesk-bibtex-markdown into Markdown format, and stored in the file 'pubs.md' in the 'gh-pages' branch.  

Note: To install the templates, see the screen shot at https://github.com/alejandroerickson/bibdesk-bibtex-markdown - you have to install all of them (and one twice) so that it maches the configuration in the screen shot before it will work.   

As BibDesk has nice facilities for importing new references directly from PubMed, this makes it easy to update this list as new publications come out.
