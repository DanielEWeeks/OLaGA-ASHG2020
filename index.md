# Samoan Obesity, Lifestyle and Genetic Adaptations Study Group (OLaGA)

---

<b>In Sāmoan, *ōlaga* (pronounced /ˈoːlaŋa/) means *life*.</b>

The Obesity, Lifestyle, And Genetic Adaptations Study Group uses a life course approach to understand the origins of obesity among Samoans and other Pacific Islanders and focuses on developing culturally relevant interventions to reduce the burden of obesity and obesity-related conditions.

Goals of the Research Group

* To conduct epidemiologic research that will serve as the evidence base for developing interventions to prevent obesity
* To develop and rigorously test novel intervention approaches targeted at early life prevention of obesity and associated cardiometabolic disease
* To enhance community partnerships for local and regional capacity building

### OLaGA @ Pitt

At the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health and Schools of Medicine and Dental Medicine, our team of genetic epidemiologists, statistical geneticists, public health geneticists, biostatisticians and molecular biologists collaborates with researchers at Yale University, Brown University, the University of Cincinnati, the National University of Samoa, the Samoan Ministry of Health, and the non-profit Lutia i Puava ‘ae Mapu i Fagalele. Nestled in and contextualized by the interdisciplinary approach of the multi-institutional Study Group, our team seeks to understand the genetic determinants of obesity and concomitant cardiometabolic disease among Samoans and the interactions of those genetic factors with environmental, behaviorial and social determinants of health.

<!-- Why are we studying genetics? -->

<!-- Genetic studies test whether the genes of a group of people can explain differences in their characteristics. In our study, we are looking for genetic changes that can explain why some people are obese and others not. Healthy lifestyles are very important to preventing obesity, but genetics and also help us understand why some people become obese. -->

Our hope is that this research will come to benefit the Samoan people in Samoa, American Samoa and worldwide through
* Translation of improved understanding of the underlying biology into interventions;
* The identification of population-specific genetic determinants and prevalences or gene–environment interactions that would inform precision public health efforts;
* Building research capacity within Samoan communities; and
* Outreach to, education and empowerment of, and collaboration with Samoan communities about the ethical, legal and social implications of genetic research, genetic testing and genetics-informed interventions.

### Gratitude

We would like to acknowledge and sincerely thank the Samoan government, particularly the Ministry of Health; the Ministry of Women, Community, and Social Development; the Office of the Prime Minister; and the Samoa Bureau of Statistics for their continued support of this work.

We would especially like to thank the amazing research participants who have allowed us to work with them over these many years and the mayors and women’s committees (*komiti tūmama*) of the villages we’ve recruited research participants from for their interest and permission to conduct this work.
